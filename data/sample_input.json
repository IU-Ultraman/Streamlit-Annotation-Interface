Community-acquired pneumonia, resolved\n2. Insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes mellitus, uncontrolled\n3. COPD with chronic hypoxic respiratory failure on home oxygen\n4. Congestive heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (EF 35%)\n5. Acute on chronic kidney disease\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:\n72-year-old male with extensive past medical history including COPD on home oxygen 2L NC, congestive heart failure with EF 35%, and insulin-dependent diabetes was admitted for community-acquired pneumonia.\n\nOn admission, the patient was febrile to 101.8°F, tachypneic with respiratory rate of 24, and hypoxic requiring 4L oxygen to maintain saturations above 90%. Chest X-ray showed right lower lobe infiltrate. He was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for CAP coverage.\n\nOf significant concern was the patient's markedly uncontrolled diabetes. Admission glucose was 287 mg/dL and HbA1c was found to be 9.1%, indicating poor long-term glycemic control. The patient admitted to not checking his blood sugars regularly at home and often forgetting his evening insulin dose. His wife reported he has been more confused over the past 3 days, likely related to the infection and hyperglycemia.\n\nCurrent diabetes medications include:\n- Insulin glargine 20 units at bedtime\n- Insulin lispro sliding scale with meals\n\nEndocrinology was consulted and recommended:\n1. Increase insulin glargine to 24 units at bedtime\n2. Add fixed dose insulin lispro 6 units with meals in addition to sliding scale\n3. Diabetes educator consult for patient and family education\n4. Close outpatient follow-up\n\nThe patient's pneumonia improved with antibiotics. He became afebrile on hospital day 2 and was able to wean back to his home oxygen requirement of 2L NC. His mental status improved as his glucose levels were brought under better control, ranging from 150-220 mg/dL by discharge.\n\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\n1. Insulin glargine 24 units subcutaneous at bedtime (INCREASED)\n2. Insulin lispro 6 units subcutaneous with meals (NEW)\n3. Insulin lispro sliding scale with meals (CONTINUED)\n4. Furosemide 40mg PO twice daily\n5. Carvedilol 12.5mg PO twice daily\n6. Lisinopril 10mg PO daily\n7. Tiotropium 18mcg inhaled daily\n8. Albuterol inhaler PRN\n9. Azithromycin 250mg PO daily x 2 more days\n\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Check blood sugar before each meal and at bedtime\n2. Take all insulin as prescribed - do not skip doses\n3. Follow diabetic diet as instructed\n4. Complete antibiotic course\n5. Use home oxygen as prescribed\n6. Weigh yourself daily, call if weight gain >3 lbs\n7. Follow up with PCP in 1 week\n8. Follow up with Endocrinology in 2 weeks\n9. Follow up with Pulmonology in 4 weeks\n\n_____________________________\nDr. Amanda Foster, MD\nHospital Medicine",
